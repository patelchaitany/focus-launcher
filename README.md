# Focus

**Reclaim your time. Spend it touching some grass.**

[![Focus: a minimalist launcher for Android](docs/banner.png)](https://how2me.me/focusapp/)

Focus is a minimalist launcher for Android: a text-only home screen built to be looked at as
little as possible. No icons, no colour: black and white, the time, up to five apps you chose,
and an honest picture of where the day went. It locks social apps and games when their daily time
is up, and once a week it shows you the week you actually had.

## What it does

**Home screen** (page 1)
- Clock inside a ring. The bright arc is the battery level (a full circle is 100%), with the
  percentage and "charging" / "low" under the date. It can show the part of the day that has passed
  instead. Tapping the circle runs an action of your choice: open any app, alarms, calendar,
  screen time, battery, or nothing. Long-press the circle to change it.
- Today's screen time in plain words under the clock: a small title, the total ("2h 41m") in
  large type, and its share of the day's 24 hours ("11% of today"). Tapping it opens the review, where the hour-by-hour picture of the day lives.
- Optional calendar section: the next events from **one** calendar of your choice. Until you pick,
  Focus shows the main calendar that actually has events coming up (the first "primary" calendar
  on a phone is often an empty local account). The picker can be searched and shows how many
  events each calendar has coming up. Emoji are stripped from titles. A Mon-Sun strip
  with today marked can be switched on; it is off because the ring has the date.
  Calendars inside an Android **Work profile** are read through the official cross-profile
  calendar API, so they only appear if the organisation managing the profile allows this app.
  When it does not, settings say so instead of showing nothing; sharing the work calendar with a
  personal Google account is the sanctioned way to get it onto the home screen.
- Two optional cards, off until you switch them on, quiet rounded panels with nothing but text in
  them (side by side when one follows the other): **music** (previous · play / pause · next work with no permission at all, as media keys; grant
  notification access and the card also shows the song and artist), and a **note** of a few lines
  that you tap to edit. The note can show a note app's own widget instead, with the colour taken
  out.
- The order is yours: hold any section on the home screen and drag it, or do the same with the
  list in Settings → Home screen → Arrange home screen, where every section can be switched off. The clock
  stays on top and the corner shortcuts at the bottom; the layout makes room by itself.
- Up to 5 "fast apps", as plain text. One that lives in a Work profile carries a small
  briefcase outline after its name, drawn in the text colour: the launcher's one pictogram.
- Two corner shortcuts (Phone / Camera by default). Long-press one to change it.
- Everything you touch lights up softly and fades back (no ripples, no colour).
- Gestures: swipe left = app drawer, swipe right = the phone's web search (the Google search box
  where there is one, like the page left of a stock home screen), swipe up = app search,
  swipe down = notifications, long-press empty space = settings, double tap = lock (on by default;
  needs the timer service). The swipes other than the drawer's, and the double tap, can be
  switched off in Settings → Gestures.

**App drawer** (page 2)
- Search bar, "installed in the last 24 hours", then every app alphabetically with an A–Z scrubber.
- "Sort" under the search bar reorders the list: A–Z, most used, or most recently used (last 7
  days, from Android's own usage totals). The scrubber only shows for A–Z.
- With an Android Work profile the list splits into **Personal** and **Work** tabs. Search always
  looks through both. Usage inside a Work profile is invisible to apps, so the Work tab stays
  alphabetical.
- Long-press an app: Uninstall · App info · Move to fast apps · App timer · Rename · Hide app.

**App timers**
- Social media and games get a daily allowance automatically (30 min by default, configurable, or
  off). Video & streaming is a third automatic group that is off until you switch it on. Any other
  app can be given a timer from its long-press menu.
- When the time is used up the app is locked behind a "Time's up" wall. From there you can close
  the app, continue for a few minutes (after a short pause), or ignore the limit for the day.
  Both escape hatches can be switched off (strict mode).
- Ignoring a limit does not make the app free for the day: Focus still asks "open anyway?" before
  **every** visit, with "Not now" as the big button and a one-tap way to bring the limit back.
  (Opened from Focus, the launcher asks; opened from a notification or recents, the timer service
  does. One yes covers the visit, until you are back on a home screen or the screen turns off.)
- Every time you go past a limit it is counted, and shown back to you.

**Weekly review**
- At the end of the week (Sunday 20:00 by default) a line appears on the home screen and a
  notification is posted. The review shows total and daily-average time, change versus last week,
  a bar per day, *when* in the day the phone was used, the top apps with when each is mostly used,
  how often limits were hit / continued / ignored, and unlock counts. It ends with one question
  and a one-line intention that is shown again the following week.

## How apps are sorted into "social", "game" and the rest

Android's own label cannot be used as is. Its `CATEGORY_SOCIAL` officially means *"messaging,
communication, email, or social network apps"* (the Play Store files its Social, Communication and
Dating categories under it), so Gmail, Chrome and WhatsApp carry the same label as Instagram.
`AppRepository.categorize` therefore works in this order:

1. **Social media**: a curated list of feeds, social networks and dating apps. Wins over everything.
2. **Game**: Android's label, which the Play Store sets reliably.
3. **Video**: a curated list (YouTube, Netflix, ...) plus Android's video label.
4. Anything else Android calls "social" is a **communication tool** if it is on a curated list, if
   the system reports that it can open a generic web page, send mail or SMS, or dial (that is how
   browsers, mail clients and messengers are recognised without naming them), or if its package
   name says so. Tools are never limited automatically.
5. Whatever is left is **unsure**: not limited, and listed under Settings → App timers → Limited
   apps → "Not sure about these", where one tap gives it a timer.

Being wrong in the strict direction (locking mail) costs more trust than being wrong in the lax
one (missing a niche social app), so the classifier never guesses towards a limit. Every automatic
decision is visible in "Limited apps" and can be overridden per app.

## Permissions it asks for, and why

| Switch | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| Default launcher | Being the home screen. |
| Usage access | All screen-time numbers: day bar, timers, weekly review. |
| Accessibility service ("Focus app timers") | Locking an app *while you are in it*. It only listens for window changes to learn the name of the app in front; `canRetrieveWindowContent` is false, so it cannot read the screen. |
| Notifications (optional) | The weekly review reminder. |
| Calendar (optional) | The calendar section. |
| Notification access (optional, "Focus music card") | The song and artist on the music card. Android ties "which player is active" to this access; the service behind it is empty and reads no notification. |

Without the accessibility service, timers still work at launch time: a spent app opened from Focus
shows the wall instead. With it, the wall also comes up mid-session.

The app declares **no INTERNET permission**. Nothing leaves the phone.

## Building

Requirements: JDK 17–21 and the Android SDK with platform 36.

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug      # debuggable build
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease    # R8-optimised build (~1.3 MB), signed with the debug key
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest  # usage state machine + emoji stripping
adb install --user 0 -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk   # --user 0: personal profile only, not a work profile
adb shell cmd package compile -m speed-profile -f com.focus.launcher   # optional: precompile right away
```

**Use the release build for daily use.** Compose is markedly slower in debuggable builds; swipes
and scrolling stutter there in a way they do not in release. `profileinstaller` is included so the
baseline profiles inside the Compose libraries are applied to sideloaded builds too.

Two machine-specific files:
- `local.properties` → `sdk.dir` (not for version control).
- `gradle.properties` → `org.gradle.java.home` is pinned to Homebrew's JDK 21, because Gradle 8.14
  cannot run on JDK 25. Remove or edit that line on another machine.

**Continuous integration.** Every push to `main` and every pull request runs the unit tests,
lint and an optimized build on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`), and the APK can be
downloaded from the run's page for 30 days. That APK is signed with a throwaway key made by the
runner: good for trying a change, but it is not the official download and cannot be installed
over it (or the other way round). This workflow uses no secrets, so it is safe for pull requests
from anyone; the real key is only ever used by the Publish workflow below. It passes the runner's
JDK with `-Dorg.gradle.java.home`, which overrides the pinned path above without touching a
tracked file.

**Versions.** `baseVersion` in `app/build.gradle.kts` is chosen by a human; the build number is the
number of commits (`1.1.13` = base 1.1, 13 commits), and it is also the `versionCode`. A build from
a newer commit therefore always installs over an older one, and nobody has to remember to bump
a number before publishing.

**Publishing from CI** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`). A push to `main` that changes the app
or the site starts a run that **waits for the owner's approval**. Once approved it runs the tests
and lint, builds and signs the APK with the real release key, refuses to go on unless the APK
carries the release certificate, the expected version and no INTERNET permission, rebuilds the
site around it, uploads it, downloads it again to compare checksums, and creates the release.
The signing key and the upload key are secrets of the GitHub environment `release`, which hands
them only to runs its required reviewer (the owner) approved, and only from `main`. The upload
key is not a login: on the server it is tied to one fixed command, `site/server/receive.sh`,
which accepts a flat archive of site files and refuses everything else. One version is one
binary: if the release for a version already exists, its APK is put on the site again instead of
building a second file with the same version. Switched on (and off) by the owner with
`site/setup-ci-publishing.sh`, which handles the keys on his machine and prints none of them;
until then the workflow skips itself.

Library versions are deliberately one step behind the newest: Compose 1.12 / core 1.19 /
lifecycle 2.11 require compileSdk 37 and AGP 9.1+. See `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

Debug builds additionally export `ReviewActivity` and `BlockActivity`
(`app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`) so they can be opened from adb:

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.focus.launcher/.SettingsActivity --es route timers
adb shell am start -n com.focus.launcher/.ReviewActivity
adb shell am start -n com.focus.launcher/.BlockActivity --es package com.instagram.android --el used 1860000 --ei limit 30 --ez preview true
```

## Website and public download

Live at **https://how2me.me/focusapp/** : a black and white, script-free landing page with the
APK download. Source in `site/src`, generated output in `site/public` (git-ignored; it contains
the APK).

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDist && site/deploy.sh   # build signed APK, build site, upload, verify
```

`deploy.sh` re-downloads the APK afterwards and compares its SHA-256 with the local build, so a
bad upload fails loudly. The page shows that same checksum.

**Releases.** Every published version is also on the
[release page](https://github.com/patelchaitany/focus-launcher/releases), with the same APK as
the website (identical SHA-256) and a `.sha256` file. When a release is published,
`.github/workflows/verify-release.yml` downloads its APKs and fails unless each one is signed
with the project's release key (certificate SHA-256
`526a00b874660af4266699d5795a457ddebe958a78484820fac4b61b2a4852a2`; check any APK yourself with
`apksigner verify --print-certs`). Releases are normally made by the Publish workflow (see
Building). By hand, from the machine that has the key: run the tests and lint,
`./gradlew :app:assembleDist && site/deploy.sh`, tag `v<version>`, then
`gh release create v<version> focus-launcher-<version>.apk focus-launcher-<version>.apk.sha256`
with the files from `site/public/`. `deploy.sh` refuses to upload an APK that differs from an
existing release of the same version.

- **Being found.** The `<title>`, description and an eyebrow inside the `<h1>` carry the phrase
  people search for ("minimalist launcher for Android"); the visible headline stays the owner's
  own line. The build derives JSON-LD (`MobileApplication` + `FAQPage`) from the page itself,
  writes `sitemap.xml`, and a `robots.txt` that is served at the domain root (it restricts
  nothing; it only names the sitemap). `deploy.sh` pings IndexNow (Bing, Yandex, Seznam, Naver)
  after every deploy. Google takes no pings: it needs Search Console. Add the property
  `https://how2me.me/focusapp/` (URL prefix), choose the HTML-file method, drop the downloaded
  `google….html` into `site/src/`, run `site/deploy.sh`, press Verify, then submit `sitemap.xml`.
  None of this substitutes for other sites linking here; nothing links to the page yet, not even
  the how2me.me homepage.
- **Hosting.** nginx on the Oracle VM. Files live in `/var/www/focusapp`, deliberately outside
  the main how2me.me root so redeploying that site cannot wipe them. The rules are in
  `site/nginx-focusapp.conf`, installed as `/etc/nginx/snippets/focusapp.conf` and pulled into
  the how2me.me server block by a single `include` line (a backup of the config from before that
  edit is at `/etc/nginx/how2me.bak-*`). Strict CSP (`default-src 'none'`, no scripts, no inline
  styles), `.apk` served as `application/vnd.android.package-archive` with
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` because nginx 1.18 does not know the type.
- **No personal data on the page.** The phone mockups are HTML/SVG with invented content. Do not
  replace them with real screenshots: those show apps, calendar names and usage.
- **Signing.** Three build types:
  `debug`; `release` (optimized, signed with the *debug* key, for the developer's own phone); and
  `dist` (the same optimized build signed with the real key, the only one that may be published).
  The key is `~/.android/keystores/focus-release.jks`; its location and password are in
  `keystore.properties` (git-ignored). **Back both up.** If they are lost, no update can ever be
  installed over a published build. Android will not install a `dist` APK over a `debug`/`release`
  one or vice versa (different signatures): switching a phone between them means uninstalling
  first, which resets Focus's settings.

## Staying small and quiet

A launcher is the one app that is always alive, so what it costs while *nothing is happening*
matters more than anything else. Measured on a OnePlus (Android 16), release build compiled with
`speed-profile`:

- **Cold start: 0.57 s of CPU in total** (main thread 0.22 s, background work 0.13 s), launch in
  ~660 ms. The first version spent 5.9 s of CPU on background work alone over a few minutes.
- **Idle on screen: 0 frames drawn and ~0 ms CPU** per 5 s. There are no looping animations;
  every animation is finite, and animated values are read in the draw phase (`graphicsLayer`,
  `Canvas`, the press indication) so they repaint without recomposing.
- **In the background: nothing runs.** The once-a-minute refresh, the clock tick and the battery
  listener are tied to the lifecycle and stop when the home screen is not visible. No services
  besides the accessibility service (event-driven), no periodic jobs, one inexact alarm a week.
- **Screen time is a running total.** `UsageRepository.DayAccumulator` feeds each system event to
  a long-lived `ForegroundTracker` exactly once; a refresh only asks the OS for events since the
  previous one (leaving the last 1.5 s to settle, because the OS writes its log from another
  thread). Re-reading the whole day on every return home, as the first version did, meant
  iterating tens of thousands of events a hundred times a day. When nothing changed, the very same
  `DayUsage` object is handed back, so nothing recomposes either.
- **Cold start does not re-read 200 labels.** Loading a label opens that app's resources (seconds
  in total). The remembered list stores each package's `lastUpdateTime`; a label is only loaded for
  apps that are new or updated, and the cache is tied to the locale. A single install/update
  refreshes just that package instead of rescanning everything.
- **The calendar agenda is cached** until the calendar provider reports a change (a
  `ContentObserver` that only flips a flag), an event in it ends, or ten minutes pass.
- **Apps open over the whole screen from their first frame** (scale-up from 94%, fading in). An
  earlier "clip reveal" that grew out of the tapped row looked good but hid most of the new app
  for the first half of the animation, so every launch felt late; from the clock ring at the top
  it was worst. Note that since Android 13 resource animations (`makeCustomAnimation`) are ignored
  for task-level transitions such as a launcher opening an app; only the built-in scale-up and
  clip-reveal types are honoured. The system's own animation is one setting away (Appearance →
  Opening apps). Each launch logs how long the
  launcher took to hand over (`adb logcat -s FocusLaunch`), to compare with the system's
  `Displayed … +NNNms`, which is the opened app's own start-up time.
- **Swipes fade with `CompositingStrategy.ModulateAlpha`**, not through a full-screen off-screen
  buffer per page per frame.
- **Memory:** no icons, no images, no Material library, no database; settings and day files are
  small JSON. The app's own Java heap is 6-10 MB. Total PSS reads anywhere from ~55 MB (settled)
  to ~95 MB (seconds after a cold start, when every code page has just been touched); most of it
  is runtime, framework and GPU-driver code shared with other apps, not data this app holds.
- **Compiled with `speed-profile`, not `speed`.** Compiling every method is marginally faster but
  maps several MB more code; compiling the hot paths named in the Compose baseline profiles
  (`profileinstaller`) gets nearly all of the speed for less memory, and is what Android does by
  itself for store-installed apps. Caches are dropped on `TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND`, and
  deliberately *not* on `UI_HIDDEN`, which fires on every app launch and would defeat them.

To check for yourself:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.focus.launcher | grep -E "Java Heap:|Native Heap:|Code:|Graphics:|TOTAL PSS:"
adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo com.focus.launcher | grep "Total frames rendered"   # run twice, 10 s apart, screen idle
```

### How screen time is computed

`UsageStatsManager.queryEvents` gives RESUMED / PAUSED / STOPPED events per activity. Android pairs
them by activity *instance*, but the instance id is hidden from apps, and apps like Instagram stack
several instances of the same activity class. Tracking by class name loses time (a late STOPPED of
an old instance closes the new one; on a real day this lost 24 of Instagram's 75 minutes).

So `ForegroundTracker` (fed by `UsageRepository.compute`) keeps, per package, a counter of resumed-but-not-yet-paused
activities, ignores STOPPED, and uses "another package resumed and no PAUSED followed within 3 s"
as the safety net for crashes and split-screen. Checked against the system's instance-aware totals
for 40 apps over a real day, every app was within 10 seconds (5:28:50 vs 5:29:20 overall).

Two things the numbers deliberately leave out, and one they cannot see. Time on a home screen is
not counted, but only *real* launchers are excluded: the Settings app also declares a HOME
activity (`FallbackHome`, priority -1000, shown while the phone boots), and mistaking it for a
launcher once made all time spent in Settings vanish. And usage inside an Android Work profile is
invisible to a normal app (`UsageStatsManager` only covers the calling user), so Focus's total can
be a little lower than Digital Wellbeing's on phones that have one.

Note that "today" means since local midnight. Android's own daily bucket does not start at
midnight, so Digital Wellbeing-style totals from `dumpsys usagestats` can differ for apps used the
previous evening.

The OS keeps raw events for only about a week, so each finished day is stored as
`files/usage/YYYY-MM-DD.json`. That is what lets the review look further back. Bump
`DayUsage.CACHE_VERSION` whenever the computation changes.
